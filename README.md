My course work for Clas299 at the College of the Holy Cross featuring analysis from numerous archaeology projects. Much of the work in the course involved coding in Scala and looking at a variety from the Mediterranean world including coin hoards, denominations of coins, tomb counts in Lycia, and a variety of other projects. Some of my coding can be found here:

For my final project, I looked at Greek Painted Pottery with my classmate, Dylan Garland. We looked at the Beazley dataset, as well as the Pioneer Group of pottery painters. We started with a large dataset, but chose to first find the most popular "shape" of pottery and then look at the spread of the pottery overtime. The code for the project can be found here:

Some interesting information was found, firstly that the hydriai was the most popular shape among the painted pottery around the Mediterranean. Also, Vulci was the most popular findspot for the hydriai pottery. This is interesting in part because although the hydriai pottery was found in Vulci 7 times in the Beazley dataset (the next closest spot behind Vulci had only one), there were only 2 Pioneer Group hydriai confirmed to be found in Vulci. It makes me wonder why the Pioneer Group was not as popular in this part of Italy. After all, the "hottest" commodity was, in fact, the hydriai shaped pottery. So, why is there far less Pioneer Group hydriais here. It cannot be due to the fact that they did not produce the shape because the hydriai was also the most popular shape the Pioneer Group produced. I look forward to diving in deeper to this issue and perhaps learning more about the cause.
