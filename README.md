### My Digital Portfolio

My course work for Clas299 at the College of the Holy Cross featuring analysis from numerous archaeology projects. Much of the work in the course involved coding in Scala and looking at a variety from the Mediterranean world including coin hoards, denominations of coins, tomb counts in Lycia, and a variety of other projects. A link to my github and a Jupyter Notebook to run any of my code can be found here:
