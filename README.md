### My Digital Portfolio

My course work for Clas299 at the College of the Holy Cross featuring analysis from numerous archaeology projects. Much of the work in the course involved coding in Scala and looking at a variety from the Mediterranean world including coin hoards, denominations of coins, tomb counts in Lycia, and a variety of other projects. A link to my github and a Jupyter Notebook to run any of my code can be found here:

For my final project, I looked at Greek Painted Pottery with my classmate, Dylan Garland. We looked at the Beazley dataset, as well as the Pioneer Group of pottery painters. We started with a large dataset and Dylan created the map below. It gave us a good idea of the sheer amount of variety of shapes. Each color on the map portrays a different number of shapes at that find spot. Naturally, Vulci caught our eye right away with 20+ different shapes found at that spot. This can be seen in the map below:

Dylan goes into more detail on this image [here](https://dylangarland21.github.io/portfolio/).
With the variety of shapes spread throughout the region, we had the idea to look the most popular shape and see if this "popular shape" could be found even in find spots with a low "shape" count. The code for discovering this idea, and the project, can be found here:

Some interesting information was found, firstly that the hydriai was the most popular shape among the painted pottery around the Mediterranean; however, it was mainly found in areas with higher shape variety like Vulci and Athens. Vulci was the most popular findspot for the hydriai pottery. This connects well with the previous finding, that being that Vulci had the most variety in shapes among the many find spots. We decided to turn our attention to which groups were responsible for the hydriai in Vulci and began looking at the Pioneer Group, one of the most famous groups of painters in the Painted Pottery Market. The results are included in the previous code link. 

Although the hydriai pottery was found in Vulci 9 times in the Beazley dataset (the next closest spot behind Vulci had only one), there were only 4 Pioneer Group hydriai confirmed to be found in Vulci. This is despite the fact that the "hottest" commodity was, in fact, the hydriai shaped pottery. So, why is there far less Pioneer Group hydriais here? It makes me wonder why the Pioneer Group was not as popular in this part of Italy, why did such a popular group have so little hydriais in one of the hottest find spots in the Mediterranean? It cannot be due to the fact that they did not produce the shape because the hydriai was, after all,  the most popular shape the Pioneer Group produced (proven by the code), or at the very least, that has been uncovered. I look forward to diving in deeper to this issue and perhaps learning more about the cause. 

An explanation may be seen in the results of the code. We see that many of the Pioneer Group hydriai have "unknown" find spots, could these have been Vulci? Did the finder simply not regard it as important to record where, when, and how these pieces were discovered?

And so, this brought up a fundamental problem with archaeology. Many of this beautiful painted pottery is sold today at high prices, an almost prize possession whose rareity is cared about as much as, if not more than, the beauty of the object. The Pioneer Group being such a highly regarded group of painters shows that many of the pottery created by them today did not have its history cared for - its find spot is regarded as "unknown" because the history of it, to many, does not matter as much as the dollar signs in their eyes. It is a sad realization and makes the job of archaeologists today increasingly tough as some have little regard to record the history of these magnificent pieces. I hope that the future brings with it an increase of reverence, appreciation, and caution with these aging, yet glorious, pieces of mankind's history.
